With WidgetWorker you get beautiful and unique widgets for your device that you can customize to your liking. Create your widget configurations inside the app and chose exactly the right configuration for your widgets. For each widget type you can create multiple configurations and swap them out inside the widget to show whatever you like, whenever you want.

Widget Builder:

A Photoshop like editor for creating totally custom widgets directly on your device. You can add 

- Weather - Fully customize weather data for your personal needs.

to your widget and position and size them as you like. There are a bunch of fonts to choose from and a great color picker to find the exact color you like.

Widget Presets:

- Website: Show any website you like inside a widget. Set the refresh interval just as you need it and the website will reload periodically so you can always stay up to date. For power users there is even the possibility to add HTTP headers to the request.
- Note: Write and show any text inside a widget. Customize the look of the note and text to match you style. Change colors and fonts to create the look you like.
- Map: Choose a place or set a location, adjust the zoom level, set a map type and you are off to a great looking map widget.
- Drawing: Use your pencil or finger to draw whatever you like and show off you skills in a widget.
- Photo: Choose one or more of your favorite photos to show in a widget. Optionally select an interval to automatically cycle through them.

Many more widget types are in the making and I can’t wait to show them to you. If you have an idea for a widget you would like to see them please write me from inside the Settings menu of the app.

When creating your widget configuration in the app you get a live preview of the widget in all the different sizes so making the configurations is easy and fast without the need to try out changes in the actual widget itself.

Of course all your widget configurations are synced across your devices so you can access them wherever you like.

The use of WidgetWorker is free of charge. Within the app, you can sign up for „WidgetWorker Pro“ subscription if you need to create more than 5 widget configurations or want to consume weather data. If you choose to subscribe, you will pay the price set for your country as shown inside the app, which is US$0.99 per month or US$9.99 per year, or the equivalent in your currency. When you purchase a subscription, your iTunes account is immediately charged for the first month at confirmation of purchase. Each subscription automatically renews for another month or year unless you choose to disable automatic renewal (via the Account Settings of your OS device or via the Manage Your Subscriptions button in the Settings menu of the app) at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period. The cost of a renewal by one month or year is the same as the cost of the original subscription. If automatic renewal happens, your iTunes account will be charged for the next subscription period up to 24 hours prior to the current subscription period. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period. Any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when purchasing the subscription.
